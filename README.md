Current state of the data can be best followed on branch dev-aama. Introductory information about the project will be found in the directory aama/docs/slides, and a DocBook-style overview of the data as it existed in February, 2013, in aama/docs/docbook/AAMADocumentation.html.

Otherwise the data is in the process of progressive revision, and the contents of any subdirectory can change from day to day.
