Reformulate data documentation guide:
	1.	Archive is a tool for exploring and comparing data from different sources. documentation not intended to be more than summary and aide-memoire. Serious work with data presumes soem familiarity with fuller documentation in underlying monographs.
	2.	Nevertheless a feasible initial goal for the archive is to provide summary documentation for each language and language variety, as an introduction (preliminary presentation) and aide-memoire. This consists initially of:
		a.	The basic geographic and demographic (provided in most cases by links to Ethnologue), and bibliographic information.  
		b.	A set of indices (in part automatically generated) to the material of the language which is represented in the archive:
			i.	summary information about the lexemes used in the paradigms
			ii.	a list of the paradigm properties and their values, with links to the relevant "default paradigms".
			iii.	a list of the "default paradigms", with an indication of the common and variable properties.
	3.	As the documentation process proceeds, an on-going effort is being made:
		a.	 to annotate some of the the less obvious property-value pairs with a fuller indication of their morphological and morphophonemic nature: "What does the term 'aorist' cover in this language?"; "How are 'perfect' vs 'imperfect' construed?"; "What is the phonological basis and outcome of these conjugation sub-classes?".  – Always with reference to the underlying monographs.
		b.	to provide a "narrative" characterization of aspects of the verbal and pronominal morphology.
	4.	An eventual longer-term goal would be to have the language material incorporated into a genuine, if summary,  morphological sketch. This goal of course can only be reached with the collaboration scholars with first-hand acquaintance with the relevant language data.
