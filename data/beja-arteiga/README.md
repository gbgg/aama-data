Beja is a closely related group of language varieties and dialects spoken in the Red Sea coastal and hill regions in Sudan, Eritrea, and Egypt by more than a million individuals. The variety documented here is that of the Arteiga tribe in the vicinity of Port Sudan and Suakin, Sudan. This variety was studied by Richard Hudson (see especially Hudson 1976), and the data has been made conveniently available in a survey article by David Appleyard (Appleyard, 2007a).
