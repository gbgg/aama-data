## :geodemoTXT "Standard Somali is based principally on the Northern variety of a group of closely related 'Somaloid' language varieties spoken in the Horn of African and Kenya. Standard Somali is spoken throughout the region historically known as Somalia, and in adjacent countries (Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya). The paradigms are a combination of Saeed1999 and Orwin1995."
