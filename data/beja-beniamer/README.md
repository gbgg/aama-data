Beja is a closely related group of language varieties and dialects spoken in the Red Sea coastal and hill regions in Sudan, Eritrea, and Egypt by more than a million individuals. One of the Southern-most representative of Beja is documented here, that of the Beni-Amer in Barka, in what is now Eritrea, studied by Leo Reinisch (1893) in what is, along with Almkvist's study of the Bishari, one of the earliest monographs dedicated to a variety of Beja.
